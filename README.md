## Data Imputation Techniques during Mechanical Ventilation Periods

Mechanical Ventilation is a critical life-saving intervention for patients facing respiratory failure in healthcare settings. However, the reliability of data collected during these ventilation periods is often compromised due to interruptions, sensor failures, and various other issues, resulting in incomplete datasets. The "Data Imputation Techniques during Mechanical Ventilation Periods" research project addresses this crucial challenge by exploring and comparing different data imputation techniques.
